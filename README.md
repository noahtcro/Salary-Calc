# Salary Calculator

A console application that takes different wage inputs from the user, stores them in variables, and displays conversions such as hourly, monthly, and annual earnings.




## Features

- Loops
- Variables
- Functions


## Lessons Learned

The implementation of switches instead of loops led to a visably cleaner code base. The addition of functions has also contributed to increased ease of use when modifying the existing code base as well.


## Optimizations

As of the current version, functions have been added in order to better organize program processes, and in turn make it easier to troubleshoot or change feature performance.


## Roadmap

- Develop classes to hold multiple variables such as all 3 converted wage types.

- Develop a standard GUI for improved user experience.
